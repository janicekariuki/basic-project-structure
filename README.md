Akan Name Generator
Description
The Akan Name Generator assigns traditional Akan names based on gender and the day of birth. It uses the Akan naming system, where each day of the week corresponds to a specific name for males and females.

Simple web-based application that works in any browser.

How to Use

Enter your birthday using the date input field.

Click the "Generate Name" button.

The app will display your Akan name, along with the corresponding day of the week.

Day of the Week Calculation
The day of the week is calculated using a custom formula based on the year, month, and day of birth:

d = ((4 × CC − 2 × CC − 1) + (45 × YY) + (1026 × (MM + 1)) + DD) % 7
Where:

CC = First two digits of the year (e.g., for 1989 → CC = 19)

YY = Last two digits of the year (e.g., for 1989 → YY = 89)

MM = Month (1 to 12)

DD = Day

The result of this calculation determines the day of the week (Sunday through Saturday), and the corresponding Akan name is selected.
